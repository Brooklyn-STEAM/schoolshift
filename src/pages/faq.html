    <summary class="rounded shadow text-3xl w-[67%] p-6">Are you working with the Department of education on a federal level?</summary>
    <p>No. We are not working anything related with the department of education, as we of right now are not on the level. If we were to be on the fedaral goverment level with the DOE, we would have contacted every school in NYC and their opinions on the DOE rules and how it should be changed.</p>

    <p class="indent-px">Yes. As expected we will eventually have an issue with the Department of Education. But it is not something like an argument. It is more like a way of hearing each other out, where one listens to the other persons opinion and then the other person talks about their opinion while the person who talked about their opinion will listen to the other opinion that they disagree on. In others words, yes we do have conflicts but not in a way where it is very chaotic</p>

    <summary class="rounded shadow text-3xl w-[67%] p-3">How will you develop to take over the Department of Education?</summary>
    <p>First as of right now we start small, meaning that we start with no resources and no support. To develop ourselves, we must benefit on gaining the money and recources that are school related. The next step is to at least contact a school from NYC that would want to be partner with us. If the process is complete, we will be able to reach the final step, which is to repeat this for EVERY school and overthrow the Department of Education.</p>
