                        <p>SchoolShift Srategies revolves around our goal of reaching to as many students as possible
                            to give them the edcation they deserve.We here at SchoolShift undertsand the struggles that
                            some school have to go through.
                            Some struggles being their lack of materials.Low funding,trouble raising money.Our job is to
                            help them in the right
                            direction.When we first got our company up and running,instead of us reaching out to schools
                            to offer up our support,
                            certain schools have contacted us for assistance.This is why here at SchoolShift we believe
                            that connections here should
                            work both ways.

                        <p>There have been many scenarios where some schools chose not to trust us.That reaction is completely understandable seeing 
                            as how some schools were negatively affected by the Education system.Seeeing as how some flaws include mental health issues regarding students,
                            it's important to remeber that when we reach out to schools,we reach out to their students as well.There has even been some controversey
                            stating how the education system deserves all the criticism it gets.There are a major number of flaws inside the DOE but there are 
                            several numbers regarding the good things.The way we see it at SchoolShift,we refuse to give any client the bare minimum.When 
                            schools contact us they are putting their trust in them to help guide them.

                        <p>Here at school shift Startegies we offer as much help as we possible can.The process of our Partnerships work as such.
                            Using a school such as Science Skills Center High School for example.Lets say that the school principle would contact us explaining their 
                            issues,as exlained before,it could be about not having materials,safety precautions.In more serious cases,the issue could revolve around 
                            security regulations.After recieiving these issues,our contact team gets into contact with the Department of Education.From there
                            Some of our employees perosnally talk to the DOE about coming to a compromise about how to tackle the schools issue.Our Partnerships
                            with other schools hace impacted the way they see us.From some perspectives,we are seen as a small branch from the DOE.
