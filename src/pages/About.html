                        <p>School Shift Srategies revolves around our goal ofreaching to as many students as possible
                            to give them the edcation they deserve.We here at SchoolShift undertsand the struggles that
                            some school have to go through.
                            Some struggles being their lack of materials.Low funding,trouble raising money.Our job is to
                            help them in the right
                            direction.When we first got our company up and running,instead of us reaching out to schools
                            to offer up our support,
                            certain schools have contacted us for assistance.This is why here at SchoolShift we believe
                            that connections here should
                            work both ways.

                        <p>The thought process of our business was a little if not completely backwards.After analyzing ou goals
                            and getting everything together.Mand my colleagues realized we had no name.The thing that we all find funny to 
                            this day is where we got the inspiration from.Our motto.Our motto is "Shift your mind.Strategize your future."That alone gave us the 
                            spark we needed.Our goals revolve around the future of schools
