                schools and the DOE.</h1>

            <ul>There have been many scenarios where some schools chose not to trust us. That reaction is completely
                understandable seeing
                as how some schools were negatively affected by the Education system. Seeeing as how some flaws include
                mental health issues regarding students,
                it's important to remeber that when we reach out to schools,we reach out to their students as well.
                There has even been some controversey
                stating how the education system deserves all the criticism it gets. There are a major number of flaws
                inside the DOE but there are
                several numbers regarding the good things. The way we see it at SchoolShift,we refuse to give any client
                the bare minimum. When
                schools contact us they are putting their trust in them to help guide them.

            <ul>Here at school shift Startegies we offer as much help as we possible can. The process of our Partnerships
                work as such.
                Using a school such as Science Skills Center High School for example. Lets say that the school principle
                would contact us explaining their
                issues,as exlained before,it could be about not having materials,safety precautions. In more serious
                cases,the issue could revolve around
                security regulations. After recieiving these issues,our contact team gets into contact with the
                Department of Education. From there
                Some of our employees perosnally talk to the DOE about coming to a compromise about how to tackle the
                schools issue. Our Partnerships
                with other schools hace impacted the way they see us.From some perspectives,we are seen as a small
                branch from the DOE.
